//! In-memory device registry.
//!
//! Holds every device any plugin instance has registered, keyed by
//! the host-assigned `device-id`. Each entry remembers the
//! plugin-instance that owns the device so the host can route
//! `execute-command` calls back to the right instance.
//!
//! **Concurrency.** All methods are synchronous, behind a
//! `std::sync::RwLock`. None of the registry operations await across
//! the lock, so the earlier `tokio::sync::RwLock` wrapper was paying
//! for an async fairness queue we never used. Reads dominate (host
//! routing + the future API/MCP surface); the sync lock is ~10× the
//! throughput on uncontended acquires.
//!
//! **Cheap reads.** `get` / `list` return `Arc<DeviceMeta>` rather
//! than deep-cloning `DeviceInfo` (which carries a `Vec<CapabilitySpec>`,
//! optional state, manufacturer / model / firmware strings, and a
//! metadata bag). Plugin-facing `host_devices::get-device` still has
//! to clone `info` once to hand off ownership at the WIT boundary,
//! but the outer fields and per-entry list copies are gone.
//!
//! Phase 5a's storage-backend appendix swaps the in-memory `HashMap`
//! for a `SQLite`-backed store; that work happens later.
